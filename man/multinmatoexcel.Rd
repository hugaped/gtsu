  decimals = 2,

}
\arguments{
\item{nma}{A \code{multinma} consistency model of class \code{"stan_nma"}}

\item{ume}{A \code{multinma} UME model of class \code{"stan_nma"}. Only needs to be specified
if user wants to add results for the Unrelated Mean Effects model alongside direct
estimates from the NMA.}

\item{outstr}{A string representing an outcome name. This is used to
label the outputted Excel workbook.}

\item{out.folder}{A string representing a folder path location. If the folder specified
in \code{out.folder} does not exist then a new one will be created.}

\item{modnam}{A string representing the name of the model used}

\item{decimals}{The number of decimal places to which to report numerical results}

\item{eform}{Indicates whether treatment effect outputs should be exponentiated or not
(i.e. if model was on log scale).}

\item{scalesd}{A number indicating the SD to use for back-transforming SMD to a
particular measurement scale. If left as \code{NULL} then no transformation will be
performed (i.e. leave as \code{NULL} if not modelling SMDs)}

\item{trt_ref}{The name of the reference treatment against which the pooled treatment
effects will be plotted and shown in an \verb{Effect size} worksheet.}

\item{lower_better}{Logical to indicate whether lower scores are ranked as better (\code{TRUE})
or not (\code{FALSE})}

\item{devplot}{Whether to add a Dev-Dev plot showing the deviance of the UME vs NMA
model. To allow this, \code{addume} must be set to \code{TRUE} (see requirements for this), and
the \code{dev} node of both NMA and UME models must have been monitored.}

\item{netplot}{Whether to plot a network plot within a \verb{Network Plots} worksheet}

\item{forestplot}{Whether to plot forest plots in the \verb{Effect size vs reference} worksheet}

\item{rankplot}{Whether to plot cumulative rankograms in the \code{Ranks} worksheet}

\item{pval}{Numeric threshold for p-value for direct vs indirect estimates. Note that this is
an approximation as it assumes the posterior is normally distributed, and the data is correlated
...i.e. it is not a true indicator of direct vs indirect (nodesplitting would be needed for that).
It should only be used to highlight comparisons for further investigation.}
