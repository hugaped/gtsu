Description: Package for internal use by the Bristol Guidelines Technical Support Unit. Package includes
    a range of functions for preparing, analysing, plotting and generating results from Network Meta-Analyses.
    Note that the package does not run specific NMA models, but only handles data to be sent to BUGS or JAGS, and
    to handle results generated by those softwares. This allows for models of high complexity to be fitted, provided
    the key parameters used for outputs are named consistently to allow handling by the `gtsu` package.
